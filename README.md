# 🚀 My Tech & Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi there! 👋  
I’m a 16-year-old developer passionate about how technology can automate processes and solve real-world problems.  
My goal is to master development and cybersecurity to create impactful and scalable solutions.

## 🧠 About Me
- 🧑‍💻 Currently learning **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Web Hacking**
- 💡 I love solving logical problems and building smart tools
- 🎯 Ambition: To develop innovative systems and projects that can scale

## 📁 Projects
- todolist.py (work in progress, this is a script that I started tonight to master python basics. Now, I will add the possibility to say that a task is completed, to delete a task and save the todolist in a *.txt file)
